If you accidentally added the `.env` file to your Git repository, you need to remove it from the repository while keeping it locally. Follow these steps:

1. Remove the `.env` file from the Git index:
    ```bash
    git rm --cached .env
    ```

2. Commit the change:
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Remove .env file from repository"
    ```

3. Push the changes to the remote repository:
    ```bash
    git push
    ```

Now, `.env` will no longer be tracked by Git, and your `.gitignore` will ensure it stays untracked.
